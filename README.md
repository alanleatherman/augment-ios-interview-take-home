2. **Location Fetching**: Uses CoreLocation to get precise coordinates with timeout handling
3. **Weather Retrieval**: Automatically fetches weather data for current location
4. **Persistence**: Current location is saved as a special city entry that updates automatically
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback with user-friendly error messages and recovery actions

#### Location Permission States
- **Not Determined**: Shows "Use Current Location" button with permission request
- **Denied/Restricted**: Shows "Enable Location Access" with direct link to Settings app
- **Authorized**: Shows "Add Current Location" for immediate weather data

### City Management System

#### Adding Cities
1. **Search Interface**: Tap "+" to open intelligent city search
2. **Dual Search Strategy**: 
   - Primary: MKLocalSearch for comprehensive location results
   - Fallback: CLGeocoder for address-based search
3. **Smart Filtering**: Removes duplicates and limits results to 10 most relevant cities
4. **Instant Addition**: Selected cities are immediately added with weather data fetching

#### City Search Features
- **Real-time Search**: 500ms debounce for optimal performance
- **Comprehensive Results**: Searches localities, administrative areas, and points of interest
- **Global Coverage**: Supports international cities with proper country codes
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Intelligent filtering based on name and country

### Weather Data Flow

#### API Integration
- **Current Weather**: Real-time conditions from OpenWeatherMap `/weather` endpoint
- **5-Day Forecast**: Detailed forecasts from `/forecast` endpoint with 3-hour intervals
- **Smart Caching**: 10-minute cache for current weather, 1-hour cache for forecasts
- **Offline Support**: Cached data available when network is unavailable

#### Data Transformation
1. **API Response**: Raw JSON from OpenWeatherMap
2. **Model Conversion**: Transform to domain models with computed properties
3. **UI Presentation**: Weather-appropriate theming and formatting
4. **Persistence**: Cache in SwiftData for offline access

### Dynamic Theming System

The app features a sophisticated theming system that adapts to weather conditions:

#### Weather-Based Backgrounds
- **Sunny**: Warm yellow to orange to light blue gradient
- **Partly Cloudy**: Light blue to medium blue to light gray
- **Cloudy**: Cool gray to medium gray to blue-gray
- **Rainy**: Deep blue to medium blue to blue-gray
- **Stormy**: Dark gray to deep blue to storm gray
- **Snowy**: Cool white to light gray to icy blue
- **Foggy**: Soft gray to muted gray to cool gray

## API Configuration

### OpenWeatherMap API Key Setup

The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather data. For development purposes, the API key is currently stored in `APIConfiguration.swift` with basic obfuscation.

### Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important**: The current implementation includes basic API key obfuscation for demonstration purposes. This is **NOT secure for production** and is only suitable for take-home projects and development.

**Current Implementation Limitations:**
- API key is embedded in client code (can be reverse engineered)
- Obfuscation provides minimal security against determined attackers
- API quotas can be exhausted by malicious users
- Keys cannot be rotated without app updates

### Production-Ready Security Approach

In a production environment, **API keys should NEVER be embedded in client applications**. Instead, implement these security measures:

#### 1. Server-Side API Proxy (Strongly Recommended)
```
iOS App → Your Authenticated Backend → OpenWeatherMap API
```

**Implementation:**
- Create backend endpoints: `/api/weather/current`, `/api/weather/forecast`
- Require user authentication (JWT tokens, OAuth, etc.)
- Store API keys securely on your servers only
- Implement rate limiting per user/device
- Add server-side caching to reduce API costs
- Monitor and log all API usage

**Benefits:**
- ✅ API keys remain completely secure
- ✅ User authentication and authorization
- ✅ Granular rate limiting and quotas
- ✅ Real-time key rotation without app updates
- ✅ Comprehensive usage analytics
- ✅ Cost control and optimization

#### 2. Alternative Security Measures (If Direct API Access Required)

**iOS Keychain Storage:**
```swift
// Store user-specific tokens, not API keys
let keychain = Keychain(service: "com.yourapp.tokens")
keychain["user_weather_token"] = userToken
```

**Certificate Pinning:**
```swift
// Pin OpenWeatherMap certificates
let pinnedCertificates = ["openweathermap.org": certificateData]
```

**Runtime Security:**
- Detect jailbroken/rooted devices
- Implement anti-debugging measures
- Use code obfuscation tools
- Monitor for tampering attempts

#### 3. Recommended Production Architecture

```

                   │ • Analytics      │
                   └──────────────────┘
```

**Security Benefits:**
- 🔒 Zero client-side API keys
- 🔐 User authentication required
- 📊 Complete usage monitoring
- 💰 Cost control and optimization
- 🔄 Real-time key management
- 🛡️ Protection against abuse

### Current Implementation Details
