# iOS Weather App - Take Home Interview

A modern iOS weather application built with SwiftUI and SwiftData, featuring real-time weather data, location services, and a clean architecture pattern that mirrors the native iOS Weather app experience.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **City Weather Tracking**: Monitor weather for multiple cities with persistent storage
- **Current Location**: Automatic weather updates for your current location via CoreLocation
- **Detailed Forecasts**: Hourly (24-hour) and daily (10-day) weather forecasts
- **Weather Persistence**: City selections and cached weather data persist across app sessions
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Manual refresh capability with automatic cache management
- **Offline Support**: Cached weather data available when network is unavailable

### Technical Highlights
- **SwiftUI + SwiftData**: Modern iOS development stack with declarative UI
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with Interactors, Repositories, and Models
- **OpenWeatherMap Integration**: Production-ready API integration with comprehensive error handling
- **Dependency Injection**: Environment-based dependency management for testability
- **Async/Await**: Modern concurrency for network operations and location services
- **Responsive Design**: Native iOS Weather app-inspired interface with adaptive layouts

## Architecture

### Design Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracted data layer with protocol-based interfaces for weather and location data
- **Interactor Pattern**: Business logic separation from UI components
- **Environment Pattern**: SwiftUI environment for dependency injection and state management
- **Observable Pattern**: SwiftUI's @Observable for reactive state updates

### Key Components

#### Data Layer
- **WeatherWebRepository**: Handles OpenWeatherMap API integration with caching and retry logic
- **LocationWebRepository**: Manages CoreLocation services and permission handling
- **SwiftData Models**: City persistence with automatic relationship management

#### Business Logic
- **WeatherInteractor**: Manages weather operations, caching strategies, and city management
- **LocationInteractor**: Handles location permissions, current location fetching, and error states

#### UI Layer
- **Native iOS Design**: Weather app-inspired interface with cards, gradients, and smooth animations
- **Responsive Components**: Adaptive layouts that work across different screen sizes
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with recovery actions

## Key Implementation Decisions

### 1. OpenWeatherMap API Integration
- **Why**: Industry-standard weather API with comprehensive data and reliable service
- **Benefits**: Real-time weather data, multiple forecast types, and global coverage
- **Implementation**: Three API endpoints (current, 5-day forecast, 16-day forecast) with smart caching

### 2. SwiftData for City Persistence
- **Why**: Modern, type-safe persistence layer that integrates seamlessly with SwiftUI
- **Benefits**: Automatic relationship management, query capabilities, and reduced boilerplate
- **Trade-offs**: iOS 17+ requirement, but provides better developer experience than Core Data

### 3. Multi-Level Caching Strategy
- **Why**: Reduces API calls, improves performance, and enables offline functionality
- **Implementation**: 10-minute cache for current weather, 1-hour cache for forecasts
- **Benefits**: Respects API rate limits while maintaining fresh data

### 4. Environment-Based Dependency Injection
- **Why**: SwiftUI-native approach that scales well and supports testing
- **Benefits**: Clean dependency management, easy testing with preview repositories
- **Usage**: Custom environment keys for interactors and coordinated operations

### 5. Location Services Integration
- **Why**: Provides personalized weather experience for user's current location
- **Implementation**: CoreLocation with proper permission handling and error states
- **Benefits**: Automatic location-based weather without manual city entry

### 6. Preview Repository Pattern
- **Why**: Enables rapid SwiftUI development with realistic sample data
- **Implementation**: Separate preview repositories that simulate API behavior
- **Benefits**: Fast iteration, reliable previews, and offline development capability

## API Integration Details

### OpenWeatherMap Endpoints
- **Current Weather** (`/weather`): Real-time conditions for immediate display
- **5-Day Forecast** (`/forecast`): 3-hour interval data for hourly forecasts
- **16-Day Forecast** (`/forecast/daily`): Extended daily forecasts for weekly view

### Rate Limiting & Caching
- **Free Tier**: 60 calls/minute, 1,000 calls/day
- **Smart Caching**: Prevents unnecessary API calls while maintaining data freshness
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to cached data when API is unavailable

### Data Transformation
- **API Response Models**: Match exact OpenWeatherMap JSON structure
- **Domain Models**: Clean, UI-friendly models for app consumption
- **Conversion Extensions**: Transform API responses to domain models with computed properties

## Future Enhancements

## Running the Project

1. **Requirements**: iOS 17.0+, Xcode 15.0+
2. **API Setup**: 
   - Get a free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
   - Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` in `WeatherWebRepository.swift`
3. **Build**: Open `augment-ios-interview-take-home.xcodeproj` and press Cmd+R
4. **Testing**: The app works immediately with preview data, add API key for live weather

## Time Investment

This implementation represents approximately 4 hours of focused development time, covering:
- Clean architecture setup and dependency injection (1 hour)
- Core weather models and repository pattern (1 hour)
- SwiftUI interface with native iOS design (1.5 hours)
- Location services and error handling (0.5 hours)

The codebase demonstrates production-ready iOS development practices while maintaining clean, readable, and maintainable code suitable for a team environment. The architecture mirrors the messaging app pattern, ensuring consistency across projects.
