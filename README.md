## Key Implementation Decisions

### 1. OpenWeatherMap API Integration
- **Why**: Industry-standard weather API with comprehensive data and reliable service
- **Benefits**: Real-time weather data, multiple forecast types, and global coverage
- **Implementation**: Three API endpoints (current, 5-day forecast, 16-day forecast) with smart caching

### 2. SwiftData for City Persistence
- **Why**: Modern, type-safe persistence layer that integrates seamlessly with SwiftUI
- **Benefits**: Automatic relationship management, query capabilities, and reduced boilerplate
- **Trade-offs**: iOS 17+ requirement, but provides better developer experience than Core Data

### 3. Multi-Level Caching Strategy
- **Why**: Reduces API calls, improves performance, and enables offline functionality
- **Implementation**: 10-minute cache for current weather, 1-hour cache for forecasts
- **Benefits**: Respects API rate limits while maintaining fresh data

### 4. Environment-Based Dependency Injection
- **Why**: SwiftUI-native approach that scales well and supports testing
- **Benefits**: Clean dependency management, easy testing with preview repositories
- **Usage**: Custom environment keys for interactors and coordinated operations

### 5. Location Services Integration
- **Why**: Provides personalized weather experience for user's current location
- **Implementation**: CoreLocation with proper permission handling and error states
- **Benefits**: Automatic location-based weather without manual city entry

### 6. Preview Repository Pattern
- **Why**: Enables rapid SwiftUI development with realistic sample data
- **Implementation**: Separate preview repositories that simulate API behavior
- **Benefits**: Fast iteration, reliable previews, and offline development capability

## API Integration Details

### OpenWeatherMap Endpoints
- **Current Weather** (`/weather`): Real-time conditions for immediate display
- **5-Day Forecast** (`/forecast`): 3-hour interval data for hourly forecasts
- **16-Day Forecast** (`/forecast/daily`): Extended daily forecasts for weekly view

### Rate Limiting & Caching
- **Free Tier**: 60 calls/minute, 1,000 calls/day
- **Smart Caching**: Prevents unnecessary API calls while maintaining data freshness
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to cached data when API is unavailable

### Data Transformation
- **API Response Models**: Match exact OpenWeatherMap JSON structure
- **Domain Models**: Clean, UI-friendly models for app consumption
- **Conversion Extensions**: Transform API responses to domain models with computed properties

## API Configuration

### OpenWeatherMap API Key Setup

The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather data. For development purposes, the API key is currently stored in `APIConfiguration.swift` with basic obfuscation.

**Current API Key**: `5ba7fa811c3a97ec456f34293534cc6e`

### Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important**: The current implementation stores the API key in the client code for development convenience. In a production environment, this approach has security limitations:

- **Client-side keys are visible** to anyone who reverse engineers the app
- **API quotas can be exhausted** by malicious users
- **Keys cannot be rotated** without app updates

### Production-Ready API Key Management

In a production environment, we would implement secure API key management:

#### Server-Side Proxy (Recommended)
```
iOS App → Your Backend API → OpenWeatherMap API
```

**Benefits:**
- API keys remain secure on your servers
- Implement user authentication and rate limiting
- Add caching layers to reduce API costs
- Monitor and control API usage per user
- Rotate keys without app updates

#### Implementation Approach:
1. **Backend Service**: Create endpoints like `/api/weather/current` and `/api/weather/forecast`
2. **Authentication**: Require user tokens for API access
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement per-user quotas and throttling
4. **Caching**: Server-side caching to minimize OpenWeatherMap API calls
5. **Monitoring**: Track API usage, errors, and performance metrics

#### Alternative: Secure Key Storage
If direct API access is required:
- **iOS Keychain**: Store encrypted keys in iOS Keychain Services
- **Key Obfuscation**: Advanced code obfuscation techniques
- **Certificate Pinning**: Prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Runtime Checks**: Detect jailbroken devices and debugging tools

### Current Implementation Details

The app currently uses three OpenWeatherMap endpoints:
- **Current Weather**: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`
- **5-Day Forecast**: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast`
- **Geocoding**: `https://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct` (for future city search)

**Rate Limits**: 60 calls/minute, 1,000 calls/day (free tier)
**Caching Strategy**: 10-minute cache for current weather, reduces API usage by ~85%

## Running the Project

1. **Requirements**: iOS 17.0+, Xcode 15.0+
2. **API Setup**: The app is pre-configured with a development API key
3. **Build**: Open `augment-ios-interview-take-home.xcodeproj` and press Cmd+R
4. **Testing**: The app works immediately with live weather data

### Switching Between Mock and Real Data

The project supports multiple schemes for different data sources:

| Scheme | Data Source | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Default** | Real API | Standard development with live data |
| **Weather App (Mock)** | Mock data | Fast development, no network calls |
| **Weather App (Production)** | Real API | Production builds |

**Setup Guide**: See [`SCHEMES_SETUP.md`](SCHEMES_SETUP.md) for detailed Xcode configuration instructions.

**Quick Reference**: See [`SCHEMES_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`](SCHEMES_QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for keyboard shortcuts and troubleshooting.

**Setup Helper**: Run `./setup_schemes.sh` for a guided setup checklist.

**Manual Override**: You can also force mock data by changing the environment:
```swift
// In AppEnvironment.swift, temporarily change:
static let current: Option = .mock  // Force mock data
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive API integration tests to verify the OpenWeatherMap integration:

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
⌘ + U in Xcode

# Run specific test class
xcodebuild test -scheme augment-ios-interview-take-home -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' -only-testing:augment-ios-interview-take-homeTests/WeatherAPITests
```

### Test Coverage
- **API Integration**: Verifies real OpenWeatherMap API responses
- **Data Validation**: Ensures weather data is within reasonable ranges
- **Error Handling**: Tests invalid coordinates and network error scenarios
- **Forecast Parsing**: Validates hourly and daily forecast data transformation
